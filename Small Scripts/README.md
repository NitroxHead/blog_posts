# My Script Collection

Welcome to my collection of small and useful scripts! This folder contains a variety of scripts that I've written to automate tasks, streamline processes, or solve specific problems.

## Usage and Other Details

For detailed information on each script and how to use it, please check out my blog post: [Script Collection Blog](https://nitroxhead.blogspot.com/2023/12/small-scripts.html).

## Contributing

If you have a script you'd like to contribute or an improvement to an existing one, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Open a pull request.

Your contributions are highly appreciated!
